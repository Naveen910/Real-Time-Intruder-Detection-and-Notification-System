# Real-Time-Intruder-Detection-and-Notification-System
In todayâ€™s world ensuring secure residential spaces is crucial, yet existing security systems often prone to
vulnerabilities. Evolving perceptions of home security align with technological progress, especially the
emergence of machine learning. Modern advancements facilitate the creation of cost-effective, efficient
security systems combining hardware and software for remote operation. Integrating IoT technologies and
machine learning, our proposed system addresses current limitations. The prevailing security setup,
relying on various automation technologies like fiber sensors and accelerometers, complicates
implementation. Accelerometers, in particular, degrade over time and are temperature-sensitive,
unsuitable for efficiency. Our solution, leveraging modern technology, features a machine learning
algorithm and IoT, providing real-time intruder detection with owner notification via SMS or prompt
action.
